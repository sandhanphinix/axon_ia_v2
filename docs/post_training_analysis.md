# Post-Training Analysis and Next Steps Guide

## Overview
This guide provides comprehensive instructions for analyzing your trained SwinUNETR model and improving your medical image segmentation pipeline.

## 1. Model Evaluation

### A. Basic Evaluation
Run the evaluation script to get detailed metrics:

```bash
# Evaluate on validation set
python scripts/evaluate.py \
    --config configs/training/swinunetr_config.yaml \
    --checkpoint /path/to/best_model.pth \
    --split val \
    --generate-report \
    --save-predictions

# Evaluate on test set (if available)
python scripts/evaluate.py \
    --config configs/training/swinunetr_config.yaml \
    --checkpoint /path/to/best_model.pth \
    --split test \
    --generate-report \
    --save-predictions
```

### B. Key Metrics to Analyze

1. **Dice Score**: Primary metric for overlap measurement
   - Target: >0.7 for good performance, >0.8 for excellent
   - Medical imaging typical range: 0.6-0.9

2. **IoU (Jaccard Index)**: Stricter overlap metric
   - Generally 10-15% lower than Dice score
   - Good complement to Dice for validation

3. **Precision**: How many predicted lesions are correct
   - High precision = fewer false positives
   - Important for clinical acceptance

4. **Recall (Sensitivity)**: How many actual lesions were found
   - High recall = fewer missed lesions
   - Critical for patient safety

5. **Hausdorff Distance**: Boundary accuracy measure
   - Lower is better (measured in voxels/mm)
   - Important for lesion boundary precision

### C. Per-Patient Analysis
- Look for patients with very low/high scores
- Identify patterns in challenging cases
- Check for data quality issues or outliers

## 2. Visualization and Quality Assessment

### A. Generate Visual Comparisons
Create overlay visualizations showing:
- Original images (multi-modal)
- Ground truth masks
- Predicted masks
- Difference maps (false positives/negatives)

### B. Error Analysis
Examine failure cases:
- **False Positives**: Where did the model predict lesions that don't exist?
- **False Negatives**: What lesions did the model miss?
- **Boundary Errors**: Where are the boundaries inaccurate?

### C. Multi-Modal Analysis
- Which modalities contribute most to performance?
- Are there cases where certain modalities are corrupted?
- Consider ablation studies removing individual modalities

## 3. Training Analysis

### A. Learning Curves
Analyze your training logs for:
- Training vs validation loss divergence (overfitting signs)
- Plateau identification (early stopping effectiveness)
- Optimal learning rate assessment

### B. Loss Component Analysis
With your combo loss (Dice + Focal):
- Which component dominates?
- Are the weights balanced appropriately?
- Consider adjusting `dice_weight` vs `focal_weight`

## 4. Model Improvement Strategies

### A. Data-Centric Improvements

1. **Data Augmentation Enhancement**
   ```yaml
   # Add to your config
   augmentation:
     rotation: [-15, 15]  # degrees
     scaling: [0.9, 1.1]
     elastic_deformation: true
     gaussian_noise: 0.1
     brightness: [-0.2, 0.2]
     contrast: [0.8, 1.2]
   ```

2. **Data Quality Improvements**
   - Review low-performing cases for labeling errors
   - Consider inter-rater agreement analysis
   - Implement quality control checks

3. **Active Learning**
   - Identify most uncertain predictions
   - Prioritize those cases for manual review/relabeling

### B. Model-Centric Improvements

1. **Architecture Modifications**
   ```yaml
   # Try different feature sizes
   model:
     params:
       feature_size: 96  # or 64, 128
       use_deep_supervision: true
   ```

2. **Ensemble Methods**
   - Train multiple models with different seeds
   - Combine predictions via averaging or voting
   - Use different architectures (UNETR, SegResNet)

3. **Loss Function Tuning**
   ```yaml
   # Experiment with loss weights
   loss:
     params:
       dice_weight: 1.0
       focal_weight: 1.0  # Increase if many small lesions
       boundary_weight: 0.5  # Add boundary loss
   ```

### C. Training Strategy Improvements

1. **Learning Rate Optimization**
   ```yaml
   optimizer:
     learning_rate: 1e-4  # Try different rates
   
   scheduler:
     type: "cosine_warmup"
     params:
       warmup_epochs: 20  # Longer warmup
       min_lr: 1e-7
   ```

2. **Progressive Training**
   - Start with lower resolution (64x64x64)
   - Gradually increase to full resolution
   - Transfer learned features

3. **Curriculum Learning**
   - Start with easier cases (larger lesions)
   - Gradually include more challenging cases

## 5. Clinical Validation

### A. Clinical Metrics
Beyond standard ML metrics, consider:
- **Lesion Detection Rate**: Percentage of lesions found
- **False Discovery Rate**: Clinical false positive rate
- **Volumetric Accuracy**: How accurate are volume measurements?

### B. Clinical Workflow Integration
- Test inference speed on clinical hardware
- Evaluate user interface requirements
- Consider uncertainty quantification for flagging uncertain cases

## 6. Next Training Iterations

### A. Warm Start Strategy
```python
# Load previous best model as starting point
# Useful for continued training with:
# - New data
# - Different augmentations
# - Modified loss functions
```

### B. Transfer Learning
- Use your trained model as backbone for related tasks
- Fine-tune on different anatomical regions
- Adapt to different imaging protocols

### C. Multi-Task Learning
Consider training on multiple related tasks:
- Segmentation + classification
- Multiple lesion types simultaneously
- Cross-modal prediction tasks

## 7. Production Deployment Considerations

### A. Model Optimization
- Convert to ONNX for faster inference
- Quantize for reduced memory usage
- Implement efficient sliding window inference

### B. Quality Assurance
- Implement automated quality checks
- Set up monitoring for distribution shift
- Create feedback loops for continuous improvement

### C. Regulatory Compliance
- Document model validation thoroughly
- Implement audit trails
- Consider FDA/CE marking requirements if applicable

## 8. Research Extensions

### A. Advanced Architectures
- Transformer-based models (TransUNet, UNETR variations)
- Attention mechanisms
- Self-supervised pre-training

### B. Uncertainty Quantification
- Monte Carlo Dropout
- Deep Ensembles
- Bayesian Neural Networks

### C. Few-Shot Learning

- Prototype-based methods

## Recommended Immediate Next Steps

1. **Run comprehensive evaluation** using the evaluation script
2. **Generate visual reports** to understand model behavior
3. **Analyze failure cases** to identify improvement opportunities
4. **Implement enhanced data augmentation** for next training round
5. **Consider ensemble approach** if computational resources allow
6. **Document findings** and create improvement roadmap

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

### Low Dice Scores (<0.5)

- Reduce model complexity
- Collect more diverse training data

### Inconsistent Predictions
- Implement test-time augmentation
- Use ensemble methods
- Add uncertainty quantification
- Review data quality and consistency
